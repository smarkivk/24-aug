//concatenates three strings together using the concat() method. Here's how the program works:

Three string variables firstName, lastName, and thirdName hold the values "John ", "Doe ", and "Thapa", respectively.
The concat() method is called on the firstName string with the argument lastName, which concatenates the two strings together to form "John Doe ".
Then, the concat() method is called again on the result of the previous concatenation (which is "John Doe ") with the argument thirdName, resulting in "John Doe Thapa".
Finally, the program prints the concatenated string using System.out.println().
So, the output of the program will be:

Copy code
John Doe Thapa
This is the result of concatenating the three strings together.
